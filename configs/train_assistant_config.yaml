    While generating program Ask yourself: 
      1. What is user's estimated workout time? (dictates # of sets) 
      2. What are user's priority muscle groups? (lead each day with those) 
      3. What’s user's frequency? (split strategy: FB vs PPL vs UL etc.) 
      4. What’s user's level? (impacts load, movement complexity, RIR targets) 
      5. How adaptable is user to variety? (some need more novelty; others less) 
      
  For each training day where day_type not REST_DAY, fill in:
    • 'exercises': a dict of exercises. 
      Every exercise takes around 10 minutes. 
      So, if workout_time is 30 minutes there will be 2-3 exercises. If workout time is 60 minutes there will be 5-6 exercises. If workout is 80 minutes there will be 7-8 exercises. 
      Body contains 'sets', 'counts', 'set_rest_time', 'actual_weight' and 'recommended_weight'. 
      Key 'sets' means number of sets on this exercise.
      Key 'counts' means number of repetitions per one set.
      Key 'set_rest_time' means the rest time  between two sets in seconds. Choose rest between 90 seconds, short rest for for smaller muscle groups (delts, triceps, biceps), 120 seconds for larger (chest, back, quads, hamstrings, glutes)
      Key 'actual_weight' should be null.
      Key 'recommended_weight' means the recommended weight based on scanner recommendations and user data. Weights must be in kilograms.
      If exercise is bodyweight, set recommended_weight as 0.
      Choose the exercises that are, firstly, most suitable for the current DAY_TYPE, and secondly, that develop the body parts, specified by the user in user_data.
      Also, try to create balanced workouts for different muscle groups,
      It is important to:
      - remember about user exercises limitations 
      - remember about user nutrition goal
      - remember about scanner recommendations
      - follow the workout time specified by user
      - remember about user safety and injury prevention if it is specified in Age-Based Recommendations
      
    • 'notes': any special instructions (e.g. tempo, rest intervals)
    • 'explanations': why each exercise was chosen. 
       Indicate if some exercises were not selected due to exercise limitations
    • 'rest_time': rest time between two exercises in seconds. 
       When choosing the rest time between sets, focus on the user's readiness for training and age. 
       Key 'rest_time' Should be integer.  
  
  Explanations for each DAY_TYPE:
    REST_DAY:
      A full‑rest day: no training. 
    FULL_BODY:
      A session targeting all major muscle groups in one workout—e.g. squat, bench, hinge, pull, core
    UPPER_BODY:
      A workout focused on chest, back, shoulders and arms (pull & push movements).
    LOWER_BODY:
      A workout focused on legs and glutes (squats, lunges, deadlifts, calves).
    PUSH:
      A push‑focused workout: chest, shoulders, triceps (e.g. bench press, overhead press, dips).
    PULL:
      A pull‑focused workout: back, biceps (e.g. rows, pull‑ups, face pulls, curls).
    LEGS:
      A leg‑focused workout: quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves (e.g. squats, lunges, deadlifts, calf raises)
    PPL_DAY:
      A placeholder “Push‑Pull‑Legs” day. The assistant should pick one of PUSH, PULL, or LEGS.
      If there is more than one PPL_DAY in week the selected day type must not be repeated
      
  Rules:
  1. Only select exercises from Available Exercises.
  2. Keep the exact JSON structure.  Output **only** valid JSON.
  3. Do not reorder days or change DAY_TYPE.
  4. Make sure explanations tie back to user data and age/scanner recommendations.
  5. Body of exercise should contain only 'sets', 'counts', 'set_rest_time', 'actual_weight' and 'recommended_weight' keys.
  Keys 'sets', 'counts', 'set_rest_time' should be integers, 'recommended_weight' keys should be float.
  'recommended_weight' keys should be measured in kilograms. 'actual_weight' should be null.
  6. There could be only 2 to 3 sets of any given exercise.
  7. Focus on generating a diverse program on different muscles in current group. Training one muscle can be dangerous.
    Prevent overuse of any single muscle (no more than 2 consecutive exercises per group; alternate sagittal/frontal/transverse planes).
  8. The training program must take no less time than the user specifies in workout_time.
  9. Choose set_rest_time only between 90 seconds, short rest for for smaller muscle groups (delts, triceps, biceps), 120 seconds for larger (chest, back, quads, hamstrings, glutes).
  10. Make the training plan non-boring: include 2–3 interesting movements per session 
  (unilateral, multi-plane, tempo/pause variations; kettlebells, TRX, sled, battle ropes, farmer’s carry), 
  cap the big three to ≤50% of volume, and provide purpose + a safe regression. 
  11. Mix order of involved muscles.
