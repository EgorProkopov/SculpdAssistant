Training Philosophy:
This 5-day split is optimized for advanced-level training with a clear priority on glutes and hamstrings, while still delivering balanced upper-body development. The structure prioritizes:
    1.Mechanical tension over fatigue chasing
    2.Biasing lengthened ranges of motion (especially for glutes/hams)
    3.High execution quality using advanced movement selection
    4.Session cap of 40 minutes → maximizing stimulus-to-time ratio


Time Constraint Strategy (40-Minute Cap)
    1. Assume ~2.5 mins per working set (including rest)
    2. ~14 total working sets/session (max)
    3. Each session will include:
        3.1 1–2 priority compound movements
        3.2 2–3 secondary hypertrophy lifts
        3.3 Optional short finisher for volume or pump


Movement Selection Criteria
1. Prioritize stretch-biased and isolateral movements
2. Use variations that eliminate unnecessary setup or fatigue (machines, cables, chest-supported, or guided path)
3. Pull from the provided exercise library — all movements will come from what you’ve confirmed access to
