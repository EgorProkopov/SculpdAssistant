Listed days count ~10–11 sets ⇒ ~25–28 min working time, comfortably within the 40-min cap (extra time covers transitions and machine setup).

### Notes
Strict tempo (3–4 s ecc, 1-s stretch pause),
stretch-biased/isolateral movements, machine/cable preference to reduce unnecessary fatigue;
progressive effort model across weeks.
