### Estimated time
~13–16 sets/day × ~2.5 min ≈ ~33–40 min of sets + transitions/setup ⇒ ~50–60 min;
fits 60-min duration.

### Notes
Why it works: chest/shoulders prioritized 3×/week with ~12–18 effective sets each;
back/arms moderate; legs 1 day to maintain balance.
Joint-friendly (machines/cables), controlled tempo (3-1-1-0/4-1-1-0), reduced axial loading, built-in scapular health work;
age-appropriate recovery.
