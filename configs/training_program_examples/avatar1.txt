### Estimated time
Assumptions in plan:
~1 min set + 60–90 s rest ⇒ ~2.5 min per working set;
+1 warm-up set and +1 min setup per exercise (7 each = 14 min).
14 working sets × 2.5 ≈ 35 min;
35 + 14 ≈ ~49–50 min per session.

### Notes
Full-body split for ≤3 days/week;
age >40 ⇒ favor machines/stable patterns;
chest/back get extra weekly sets;
maintain strict tempo (4-1-1-0/-1) and lead with priorities when freshest.
