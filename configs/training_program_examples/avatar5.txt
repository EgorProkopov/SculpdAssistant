### Estimated time
~9–11 sets/day × ~2.5 min per set (+ short transitions) ≈ 25–30 min/session;
fits the 30-min cap.
(Assumption of ~2.5 min per work set comes from the program’s pacing guidance.)

### Notes
Primary emphasis = shoulders (Day 1 main, Day 4 secondary, Day 5 pump; rear delts also Day 3).
Joint-friendly selection (machines/cables), controlled tempo, no junk volume;
30-min efficiency;
weekly movement distribution spelled out (pressing, laterals, rear delts, hinge/squat balance).
