Notable Training Style Differences (AI vs. Eric)

1. Sets & Volume Distribution

AI style: Blanket 3 sets for nearly every movement; 6 exercises on most days (18+ working sets), which will overshoot a 60-min cap with 120 s rests; no weekly budgeting by body part.

Eric style: 2–3 sets/exercise, targeted ~12–18 effective sets/week for chest/shoulders, with moderate back/arms and one legs day; volume spread across 5 themed days to manage fatigue.

2. Exercise Selection / Novelty

AI style: Redundant chest isolation (two machine fly variants in the same session), generic rows/pulldowns; mixes triceps into a Pull day; little rear-delt or angle diversity; few stretch-biased movements.

Eric style: Cable/machine dominant with angle control and stretch bias (incline cable fly, decline/upper chest fly, staggered-stance fly); Smith pressing for joint safety; deliberate delt work (machine lateral, crossover lateral, Y-raise, rear-delt fly, face pulls); back thickness via plate-loaded chest-supported row; glutes/hams with lying curl, walking lunges.

3. Muscle Group Structuring / Order

AI style: PPL + extra PPL days; no clear weekly chest/shoulder prioritization; legs get large volume on one day and then more push/pull volume dilutes focus.

Eric style: 5-day rotation:

Chest focus, 2) Shoulders focus, 3) Back+Arms, 4) Chest+Shoulders pump/isolation, 5) Legs (functional/recovery). Chest/shoulders prioritized 3×/week with purposeful sequencing.

4. Rest Times

AI style: Mostly 120 s across the board; no tempo standard; no time-efficiency logic.

Eric style: Rests aligned to ~60 min sessions; strict 3-1-1-0 / 4-1-1-0(-1) tempos to raise TUT so fewer sets still stimulate hypertrophy; sequencing/supersets used to stay on schedule.

5. Back & Pull Days

AI style: Pulldown + seated row loops; adds triceps pushdowns to Pull day (mismatch); lacks rope pullover and chest-supported thickness emphasis; minimal rear-delt/face-pull work.

Eric style: Balanced lat vs upper-back: lat pulldown + kneeling low cable row and plate-loaded chest-supported row; arms via rope curls/drag curls; triceps on push-oriented days; face pulls/rear-delt flys for scapular health.

6. Leg Days

AI style: Very high machine volume (press, ham curl, calves, abduction, glute bridge, cable RDL) with long rests—poor time efficiency; lacks walking lunges/hack squat/lying curl emphasis.

Eric style: One dedicated legs day: hack squat, lying ham curl, calves, walking lunges, optional adduction/abduction—joint-friendly, high stimulus-to-fatigue, fits 60-min window.

Training Style Prompt for AI

“Generate a 5-day program in Eric’s style for an advanced 55-year-old prioritizing chest & shoulders, with ~60-minute sessions. Use machine/cable-dominant, joint-friendly selections, emphasize stretch-biased work, and manage fatigue. Output valid JSON only.

Weekly Split & Session Rules

Days: 5 ("day 1"…"day 5").

day_type values and themes:

CHEST_FOCUS — Upper + mid chest (press + multiple fly angles)

SHOULDERS_FOCUS — Medial & rear delts + safe pressing

BACK_ARMS — Lat + upper-back thickness + biceps + triceps (cable)

CHEST_SHOULDERS_PUMP — Isolation/pump angles, higher reps

LEGS_FUNCTIONAL_RECOVERY — Quad-biased hack, lying ham curl, calves, lunges

session_duration_min: 60.

Sets per exercise: 2–3; target 13–14 total sets/session.

Prioritize chest & shoulders 3×/week (two direct days + one hybrid).

Exercise Selection (angle diversity, stretch bias, joint-friendly)

Chest: Incline Smith press; incline bench-supported cable fly (upper); mid-chest cable fly (staggered stance); machine chest press; decline/upper cable fly for pump days.

Shoulders: Machine lateral raise, cable crossover lateral, cable Y-raise, Smith shoulder press, rope face pull, reverse fly (stretch-biased).

Back/Arms: Lat pulldown, kneeling single-arm low cable row, plate-loaded chest-supported row; rope bicep curl, drag curl, V-grip pushdown.

Legs: Quad-biased hack squat, lying ham curl (stretch-biased), seated calf raise, walking DB lunges; optional adduction/abduction finisher.

Prefer cable/machine/Smith; use DBs selectively (e.g., flat DB press, lunges).

Reps, Tempo, Rest

Rep ranges: presses/rows 6–12; flys/laterals/rear-delts 10–15(20); curls/pushdowns 10–15; legs: hack 8–12, lunges 10–12/leg, ham curl 10–12, calves 12–15.

Tempo (tempo): default "3-1-1-0"; use "4-1-1-0" or "4-1-1-1" on stretch-biased flys, reverse flys, and lengthened lat work.

Rest (rest_sec): compounds 90–120, isolations 60–90; allow time-efficient sequencing/supersets on small isolations.

Constraints & Safeguards

Do not invent 1RMs or prescribed weights; keep "actual_weight": null.

Keep triceps on push days and biceps on pull day (avoid mixing triceps into Pull sessions).

Ensure rear-delt + face pull appear at least 2×/week.

Legs: one dedicated day; no heavy axial loading (no barbell back squats/deadlifts).

Maintain multi-angle chest work each chest-involved day (stretch fly + press).

Stay inside ~60 minutes via set counts, rests, and optional small-isolation supersets.
