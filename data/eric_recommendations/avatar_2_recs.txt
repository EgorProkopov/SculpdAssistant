Notable Training Style Differences (AI vs. Eric)

1. Sets & Volume Distribution

AI style: Mostly 3×8–10 per lift; ~9 working sets/day but concentrated into 3 exercises, creating overlong blocks per movement and risking time overrun with 120s rests. No weekly set budgeting.

Eric style: 2 sets per exercise (occasional 1–2 “finishers”); ~9–10 total sets/session to hit a strict 30-min cap. Clear allocation: 3–4 sets glute/ham, 3–4 compound push/pull, 1–2 arms/shoulders.

2. Exercise Selection / Novelty

AI style: Barbell-heavy (RDL, bench, squat) plus generic accessories (rear delt fly, plank, twists). Sparse use of machines/cables; no pullovers, abductions, or leg curls.

Eric style: Pattern- and bias-driven choices (RDL/hip thrust, ham curl, lat pullover, abduction). Uses machine/cable options for efficiency, setup speed, ROM control; compounds included but balanced with stable variations.

3. Muscle Group Structuring / Order

AI style: Lists movements without priority ordering; glute/ham priority stated but not enforced (e.g., Day 3 opens with squat + incline press, no ham isolation).

Eric style: Lead with posterior chain on most days (RDL/hip thrust/split squat early), then alternate push ↔ pull to manage fatigue; isolations late. Weekly plan repeats glute/ham priority across all three sessions.

4. Rest Times

AI style: Per-exercise set_rest_time = 120–90 s regardless of movement size; tempo fixed at 3-1-1-0; no time budget logic.

Eric style: Rest matched to 30-min budget: large patterns ~90–120 s, isolations 60–90 s; tempos mainly 4-1-1-0 (some 3-1-1-0 on unilateral/leg patterns) to drive TUT without inflating total time.

5. Back & Pull Days

AI style: Minimal variety—only one vertical pull day (lat pulldown) and no pullover or distinct upper-back row emphasis; no angle rotation.

Eric style: Alternates lat-bias vs upper-back-bias; explicitly programs lat pullover and machine/cable rows for angle diversity; keeps sets to 2 for quality, not fatigue.

6. Leg Days

AI style: Uses RDL, squat, and glute bridge machine, but omits hamstring curls and split-squat/hinge variations; core replaces lower-body isolation on two days.

Eric style: Guarantees 3–4 sets glute/ham per session via RDL/hip thrust + ham curl + split-squat/leg press variants; includes abduction block; avoids redundant heavy pairings that blow the clock.

1. Session & Volume Rules

Days/week: 3 ("day 1", "day 2", "day 3"), each with "day_type": "FULL_BODY" and "session_duration_min": 30.

Working sets/session: 9–10 total.

Sets per exercise: 2 by default; allow a single 1-set finisher (e.g., triceps or abduction). Do not assign 3+ sets to most lifts.

2. Exercise Selection (pattern-first)

Posterior chain priority each day: choose from RDL (DB/BB), hip thrust (Smith/BB), split squat (DB/Smith), hamstring curl (seated/lying), glute-biased leg press/step-up.

Pull diversity: alternate lat-bias (pulldown/pullover) and upper-back bias (machine/cable row).

Push diversity: rotate incline press → flat/mid press → fly using machine/DB/cable.

Accessories: lateral raise, triceps overhead extension or pushdown, abduction.

Prefer machines/cables for speed and ROM control; include barbell only where it adds ROI (RDL, hip thrust).

3. Reps, Tempo, Rest

Rep ranges: upper body 8–12, lower body 8–12 (ham curls/abduction 10–15 allowed).

Tempo: default "4-1-1-0"; unilateral/split-squat may use "3-1-1-0"; optionally use "6-1-1-0" on one squat/hinge in Day 3.

Rest (rest_sec): compounds 90–120, isolations 60–90. Keep the 30-min cap in mind.

4. Output Schema
For each day:

{
  "day X": {
    "day_type": "FULL_BODY",
    "session_duration_min": 30,
    "notes": "Lead with posterior chain; alternate push/pull; isolate at end.",
    "exercises": {
      "Exercise Name": {
        "movement_pattern": "e.g., hip hinge (RDL), lat-biased pull, upper-back row, incline press, ham curl, abduction",
        "equipment_preference": "machine|cable|db|barbell|smith",
        "sets": 2,
        "rep_range": "8-12",
        "tempo": "4-1-1-0",
        "rest_sec": 90,
        "actual_weight": null
      }
      // 4–5 exercises total; ensure 9–10 working sets per day
    }
  }
}


Ensure across the week: glute/ham = 3–4 sets/day, compound push/pull = 3–4 sets/day, 1–2 sets arms/delts/abduction.

Do not invent 1RMs or recommended weights; leave "actual_weight": null.

Keep total time within 30 minutes by adhering to set counts, rests, and exercise count (usually 5 exercises/day).

Provide angle/plane rotation across days (pulldown vs pullover; incline vs flat press; split-squat vs hip thrust).
