Notable Training Style Differences (AI vs. Eric)

1. Sets & Volume Distribution

AI style: Uniform 3 sets on every lift; 4 exercises/day → 12 working sets; duplicated PUSH/PULL days; no weekly budgeting; rest-time conflicts (per-exercise 120s vs day rest_time: 60).

Eric style: 2–3 sets/exercise with targeted chest/back emphasis across 5 days; sessions sized for ~60 min with efficient sequencing; one active-recovery day to manage fatigue.

2. Exercise Selection / Novelty

AI style: Standard Smith/DB presses, generic rows, barbell curls; lacks stretch-biased cable fly angles, bench-supported cable work, kneeling low cable rows, or rope pullovers; repeats similar patterns across the week.

Eric style: Angle-driven, cable/machine dominant: incline/upper/mid cable fly variants, incline bench-supported cable rows, kneeling single-arm low cable row, rope pullover, plus V-grip pulldown; selective DB/Smith for overload.

3. Muscle Group Structuring / Order

AI style: PPL + extra PPL days; legs get a full day; no chest/back priority across the week.

Eric style: 5-day upper-dominant rotation:

Chest focus, 2) Back focus, 3) Active recovery/core, 4) Chest+Back combo, 5) Full upper pump. Chest & shoulders are touched 3×/week; back & arms placed strategically.

4. Rest Times

AI style: Hard-coded 120 s (and 90 s) without rationale; one global rest_time: 60. Minimal tempo guidance (“2 sec eccentric”).

Eric style: Rests aligned to ~60-min cap; consistent 3-1-1-0 / 4-1-1-1 tempos to drive TUT; small-isolation supersets optional for pacing.

5. Back & Pull Days

AI style: Pulldown + bar row + DB row + curls; no lat vs upper-back separation; no pullover; no chest-supported thickness emphasis.

Eric style: Clear lat (supinated/neutral pulldown, rope pullover) vs upper-back (plate-loaded chest-supported row, kneeling/bench-supported cable rows); arms via rope curls/drag curls; triceps kept to push/pump days.

6. Leg Days

AI style: Dedicated legs day (press, goblet, calves, abduction) with high fixed volume; not time-efficient for chest/back priority.

Eric style: One joint-friendly legs day only (hack squat, lying curl, calves, walking lunges, optional adduction/abduction) to maintain balance without stealing recovery from upper focus.

Weekly Split & Session Rules

Days: 5 ("day 1"…"day 5").

day_type values and themes:

CHEST_FOCUS — upper + mid chest (press + multiple fly angles)

BACK_FOCUS — lat isolation + upper-back thickness + biceps

ACTIVE_RECOVERY_CORE — light cardio + light isolation + core

CHEST_BACK_COMBO — heavy press + rows, plus rear-delt/posture work

UPPER_PUMP — pump-oriented upper (press, pulldown, arms, delts)

session_duration_min: 60.

Sets per exercise: 2–3; target 13–14 sets/session (use 3 sets for primary press/row; 2 sets otherwise).

Exercise Selection (angle diversity, stretch bias, joint-friendly)

Chest (through week): Incline DB/Smith press, incline bench-supported cable stretch fly (upper), mid-chest staggered-stance cable fly, machine chest press, decline or upper cable fly on pump day.

Back: Lat pulldown (supinated/neutral or V-grip), kneeling single-arm low cable row, plate-loaded chest-supported row, incline bench unilateral/mid-origin cable row, standing rope pullover.

Delts (support): machine lateral raise, cable crossover lateral, reverse cable fly (stretch-biased), rope face pull, cable rope front raise.

Arms: rope cable curls, drag curls, V-grip pushdowns.

Legs (1 day only): quad-biased hack squat, lying hamstring curl (stretch-biased), seated calf raise, walking DB lunges, optional adduction/abduction.

Prefer cable/machine/Smith; use DBs selectively for incline/flat presses and lunges.

Reps, Tempo, Rest

Rep ranges: presses/rows 6–12; flys/laterals/rear-delts 10–15(20); curls/pushdowns 10–15; legs: hack 8–12, lunges 10–12/leg, ham curl 10–12, calves 12–15.

Tempo (tempo): default "3-1-1-0"; use "4-1-1-1" on stretch-biased flys, reverse flys, and lengthened lat work.

Rest (rest_sec): compounds 90–120, isolations 60–90. Superset small isolations only if needed to stay within 60 min.

Constraints & Safeguards

Do not include 1RMs or suggested weights; keep "actual_weight": null.

Keep triceps work on chest/pump days; biceps on back/pull day.

Include rear-delt + face pull at least 2×/week.

Only one legs-focused day (functional, joint-friendly).

Each chest-involved day must pair stretch-biased fly + press.

Stay inside ~60 minutes using set counts, rests, and optional small-isolation supersets.
