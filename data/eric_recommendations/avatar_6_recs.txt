Notable Training Style Differences (AI vs. Eric)

1. Sets & Volume Distribution

AI style: Uniform 3×12/15 per lift; ~9 sets/session; no time cap; no weekly block progression.

Eric style: 2-set blocks with occasional 1-set finisher; ~7–8 total sets in ~28–30 min; clear monthly progression (technique → ROM/load → volume/intensity).

2. Exercise Selection / Novelty

AI style: Heavily DB/free-weight; minimal machines/cables; lacks stretch-biased choices (cable fly, reverse fly), chest-supported rows, or targeted delt isolation (Y-raises/front raises).

Eric style: Machine/cable biased, joint-friendly, stretch-biased isolation (incline cable fly, reverse fly), chest-supported rows, Smith variations; deliberate delt library (laterals, Y-raises, front raises, upright rows).

3. Muscle Group Structuring / Order

AI style: Upper/Lower/Rest/Upper/Lower pattern; priorities (shoulders; ham/glute) not consistently led; repeats goblet squat and abduction; arms largely absent.

Eric style: 4-day rotation with explicit themes:
Day1 Push (shoulder bias) → Day2 Lower (ham/glute) → Day3 Pull (rear/med delts) → Day4 Lower (quad & calves). Lead with priority compounds, finish with isolations.

4. Rest Times

AI style: Conflicting rest_time (day-level 90–120s vs per-exercise); tempo cue 2-1-3 once, otherwise inconsistent; no pacing to a time budget.

Eric style: Rests implicitly sized to 30-min cap (≈2.5 min per working set including rest); standardized 3–4 s eccentrics + 1 s stretch pause to raise TUT without excess volume.

5. Back & Pull Days

AI style: Pulldown + seated row; no pullovers, no clear upper-back vs lat bias; no rear-delt emphasis; no chest-supported angles.

Eric style: Angle diversity & tissue biasing: incline chest-supported rope row, rope pulldown/pullover, Y-raises, stretch-biased reverse fly; optional arm finisher for balance.

6. Leg Days

AI style: Leg press/goblet/abduction; one day adds plank; no ham curl on Day2, no RDLs, no calves; duplicate movement selection across days.

Eric style: Two distinct lower emphases:
• Ham/Glute: seated ham curl, deficit Bulgarian, barbell/DB RDL, abduction.
• Quad & Calves: hack squat, foam-roller quad extension, seated + standing calves.

Weekly Split & Session Rules

Days: 4 ("day 1"…"day 4").

day_type values and themes:

UPPER_PUSH_SHOULDER_BIAS — Day 1

LOWER_HAM_GLUTE — Day 2

UPPER_PULL_REAR_MED_DELTS — Day 3

LOWER_QUAD_CALVES — Day 4

session_duration_min: 30 each day.

Working sets/day: target 7–8 total.

Sets per exercise: default 2; allow one 1-set finisher (arms/delts/calves).

Exercise Selection (stable, stretch-biased, fast setup)

Shoulders: seated/crossover cable laterals, DB/Smith shoulder press, Y-raises, front raises, upright rows (Smith/cable).

Pull: incline chest-supported rope row, single-arm cable row, rope pulldown/pullover, reverse fly (machine/cable).

Lower (ham/glute): seated ham curl (stretch-biased), deficit Bulgarian split squat, RDL (DB or supported), hip abduction.

Lower (quad/calves): hack squat (quad-biased), foam-roller quad extension, seated + standing calf raises.

Prefer machines/cables/Smith; use DBs where they don’t slow setup.

Reps, Tempo, Rest

Rep ranges: compounds 8–12, isolations 10–15 (calves 12–20).

Tempo (tempo): default "4-1-1-0" (or "3-1-1-0" on presses; "3-1-1-1" on laterals/reverse fly).

Rest (rest_sec): compounds 90–120, isolations 60–90.

Keep the 30-min cap by limiting exercises to 4–5 per day.

}


Constraints & Coverage

Shoulder bias must appear on Days 1 & 3 (medial/rear delts emphasized on Day 3).

Ham/Glute priority on Day 2; Quad & Calves on Day 4.

Include at least one chest-supported row and one stretch-biased fly/reverse-fly in the week.

Avoid redundant heavy pairings and long transitions; no 1RM or suggested weights — keep "actual_weight": null.
