Notable Training Style Differences (AI vs. Eric)

1. Sets & Volume Distribution

AI style: Defaults to 3 sets on nearly every lift; most sessions run 9–12+ working sets, with no explicit per-day cap or weekly budgeting.

Eric style: 2 sets per movement with occasional 1-set finishers; tight 30-min cap with ~5–6 total working sets/day; every set has intent (no junk volume).

2. Exercise Selection / Novelty

AI style: DB/Smitḥ staples (presses, rows, curls) and generic leg machines; minimal rear-delt, abduction, kickback, Y-raise, or rope variants; little angle/plane diversity.

Eric style: Shoulder-centric library and joint-friendly machines/cables: Smith OHP, crossover cable laterals, Y-raises, front raises, rope curls/pushdowns; lower body uses deficit Smith RDL, GHD, hip abduction, kickbacks; quads get pendulum squat, foam-roller quad extensions.

3. Muscle Group Structuring / Order

AI style: 6-day PPL with a single legs emphasis and duplicated upper days; no systemic bias to shoulders across the week.

Eric style: 5-day themed split with primary shoulder emphasis (Days 1, 4, 5), a posterior-chain day (Day 2), and quad focus (Day 5); arms integrated 2–3×/week; rear delts embedded on Pull day.

4. Rest Times

AI style: Per-exercise rests (90–120 s) plus a conflicting day-level rest_time: 60; no pacing logic tied to a time cap; inconsistent tempo cues.

Eric style: Rests sized to a 30-min session (≈2.5 min per set including rest) with controlled eccentrics (3–4 s) + 1-s stretch pause to raise TUT without inflating volume; optional supersets for efficiency.

5. Back & Pull Days

AI style: Pulldown + seated row + curls; no rope pulldown/pullover, limited chest-supported work; rear delts underemphasized.

Eric style: Angle and tissue biasing: incline chest-supported upper-back rope row, kneeling rope pulldown, reverse fly (stretch-biased); single-arm cable rows; optional forearm/biceps isolation finisher.

6. Leg Days

AI style: Leg press + seated ham curl + glute bridge; lacks hinge deficits, GHD, abduction/kickbacks, or quad-specific stretch work; calves sporadic.

Eric style: Two lower emphases:

Glutes/Hams: deficit Smith RDL, GHD, abduction, kickbacks, standing calf.

Quads/Delts pump: pendulum squat, foam-roller quad extensions, cable upright/front raise accessories.

Weekly Split & Session Rules

Days: 5 — use these day_type values and themes:

SHOULDER_ARMS — Day 1 (primary shoulder bias + arms)

GLUTES_HAMS — Day 2 (posterior chain)

BACK_REAR_DELTS — Day 3

CHEST_SHOULDERS_SECONDARY — Day 4 (secondary shoulder bias)

QUADS_ABS_DELTS_PUMP — Day 5 (quad focus + delt pump + abs)

session_duration_min: 30 for every day.

Working sets/day: 5–6 total (strict).

Sets per exercise: default 2; allow 1-set finisher on some days.

Prioritize fast setups (machines/cables) to protect the time cap.

Exercise Selection (shoulder-centric, stretch-biased)

Shoulders across the week: Smith OHP, crossover cable laterals, Y-raises, front raises, upright rows (Smith/cable).

Posterior chain: deficit Smith RDL, GHD (ham focus), hip abduction, glute kickbacks, standing calves.

Back/Rear delts: incline chest-supported upper-back rope row, single-arm cable row, kneeling rope pulldown, reverse fly (stretch-biased); optional wrist curl finisher.

Chest/secondary shoulders: incline Smith press, upper-chest bench-supported cable fly, flat-bench cable laterals, incline DB OH triceps.

Quads/abs/pump: pendulum squat, foam-roller quad extensions, front-facing front cable raise, abduction machine, rope incline upright row, core (crunches/KR).

Reps, Tempo, Rest

Rep ranges: compounds 8–12; isolations 12–15; calves 10–12; abs 15–20 or timed.

Tempo (tempo): default "4-1-1-0" (or "3-1-1-1" on lateral/iso work).

Rest (rest_sec): compounds 90–120, isolations 60–90.

Keep total working sets ≤6 and choose 4–5 exercises/day accordingly.

Constraints & Coverage

Shoulders appear on Days 1, 4, and 5 (primary, secondary, pump).

Arms included on ≥2 days (prefer rope curls/pushdowns; add incline DB OH triceps on Day 4).

Posterior chain covered on Day 2 (RDL/GHD/abduction/kickback/calf).

Quads + abs featured Day 5 (pendulum + quad extension + core).

Avoid redundant heavy pairings that slow setup; supersets permitted for small isolations if needed.

Do not include 1RM or recommended weights; keep "actual_weight": null.
