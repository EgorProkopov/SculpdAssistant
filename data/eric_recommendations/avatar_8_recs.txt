Notable Training Style Differences (AI vs. Eric)

1. Sets & Volume Distribution

AI style: Flat 3× per lift for all movements; ~15 sets/session; no weekly budgeting; no bias to chest/back per session.

Eric style: Chest + back get priority volume each day (typically 3× on primaries), legs kept to supporting 2×; ~13–14 total sets/session inside 60 min, with time-efficient sequencing (supersets when needed).

2. Exercise Selection / Novelty

AI style: Bench/DB presses, basic rows, leg press/goblet; minimal stretch-biased chest work; no bench-supported cable press, unilateral incline cable row, or rope pullover.

Eric style: Pattern-led, cable/machine dominant with lengthened-range bias: incline cable fly, downward/decline fly; bench-supported cable press; supinated pulldown; incline unilateral cable row; rope pullover; deficit Bulgarian split squat; lying leg curl; quad-biased leg press.

3. Muscle Group Structuring / Order

AI style: Three generic FULL_BODY days with similar chest/back/leg mix; no push/pull bias per day; core sprinkled.

Eric style: Rotating full-body with push/pull bias each day:

Day 1: Chest (stretch → press), Lat focus, quad accessory.

Day 2: Back thickness first, chest fly/press after, glute accessory.

Day 3: Balanced push/pull + posterior chain (pullover + ham curl).
Legs never dominate; they support chest/back priority.

4. Rest Times

AI style: Mostly 120 s (90 s on some); generic tempos (2-1-1-0 / 3-1-1-0); no time-cap logic.

Eric style: Rests align to 60-min cap (~2.5 min/set incl. rest); strict 3-1-1-0 / 4-1-1-1 tempos to drive TUT; supersets used to stay on schedule.

5. Back & Pull Days

AI style: Lat row/pulldown repeats; no explicit lat vs upper-back split; no pullover; few bench-supported angles.

Eric style: Daily lat + upper-back pairing (supinated pulldown + unilateral/bench-supported row); rope pullover appears on Day 3 for lat isolation without biceps.

6. Leg Days

AI style: Leg press/goblet volume (3×15) multiple days; no lying leg curl or deficit Bulgarian; leg work can dilute chest/back focus.

Eric style: Low-fatigue support volume only: quad-biased leg press (2×), deficit Bulgarian (2×/leg), lying leg curl (2×)—placed last to preserve upper-body quality.

Session Format & Weekly Structure

Days: 3 — rotating full body with a push/pull bias each day.

Day types (use exactly these):

FULL_BODY_CHEST_LAT (Day 1)

FULL_BODY_BACK_THICKNESS_CHEST_FLY_GLUTES (Day 2)

FULL_BODY_BALANCED_PUSH_PULL_POSTERIOR (Day 3)

session_duration_min: 60 each day.

Sets per exercise: primaries 3, accessories 2.

Target total sets/session: 13–14. Chest/back receive two movements each day (chest: stretch + press; back: lat + upper-back). Legs: 1 accessory (quad or ham/glute).

Exercise Selection (pattern-first, stretch-biased)

Chest: incline cable fly (stretch-biased), downward/decline fly, flat bench cable press (bench-supported), incline press (DB/Smith/BB).

Back – Lat bias: supinated pulldown, rope pullover.

Back – Upper-back thickness: plate-loaded chest-supported row, incline bench unilateral cable row (mid cable origin), upper-back rope row.

Legs (support only): quad-biased leg press (low/narrow), deficit Bulgarian split squat (glute-biased), lying leg curl (stretch-biased).

Prefer cables/machines; DB/BB only where specified.

Reps, Tempo, Rest

Rep ranges:

Chest press: 6–10; chest fly: 10–12.

Lat pulldown/rows: 10–12 (pullover 12–15).

Legs: leg press 10–15; split squat 8–10/leg; lying curl 10–12.

Tempo (tempo): use "3-1-1-0" for presses/rows; "4-1-1-0" for stretch-biased fly/lat work; "4-1-1-1" allowed on fly/pullover for peak squeeze.

Rest (rest_sec): compounds 90–120, isolations 60–90. Use time-efficient sequencing; supersets optional but keep quality high.

Constraints

Do not include 1RM or suggested weights; keep "actual_weight": null.

Ensure every day has: Chest (stretch + press) and Back (lat + upper-back).

Legs are supporting volume, never more than 2× in a session.

Use bench support on cable presses/rows where noted; prioritize lengthened-range selections.

Keep total work inside 60 minutes (≈2.5 min/set including rest and transitions).
