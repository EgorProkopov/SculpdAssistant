Notable Training Style Differences (AI vs. Eric)

1. Sets & Volume Distribution

AI style: Fixed 3×8–12 per lift; ~6 total movements/week; no weekly budgeting; generic tempos.

Eric style: 2 sets/exercise (≈8 sets/session) across 2 days; each day keeps chest/shoulder volume high while touching legs with low-fatigue work; tempos specified per movement.

2. Exercise Selection / Novelty

AI style: Barbell bench/squat plus DB presses; sparse cable/machine use; no stretch-biased cable fly or bench-supported cable press; lateral raises are DB-only.

Eric style: Cable/machine dominant with stretch-biased selections: incline cable fly, flat bench cable press, unilateral cable laterals, machine/Smith pressing, and glute-biased leg press/RDL options.

3. Muscle Group Structuring / Order

AI style: Two generic FULL_BODY days; chest/shoulder priority is implied but not enforced by order; lower body appears as one heavy squat or RDL block.

Eric style: Day 1: Heavy push first → posterior chain finisher; Day 2: upper isolation first → quad/glute volume. Chest/shoulders are prioritized both days; legs integrated with controlled fatigue.

4. Rest Times

AI style: Uniform 120 s (or 90 s) with no rationale; mixed day-level vs per-exercise rest fields.

Eric style: Pragmatic 90–120 s rests aligned to controlled eccentrics; rest supports quality under moderate total set counts.

5. Back & Pull Days

AI style: Minimal back isolation/angle variety; no pullovers; no bench-supported rows.

Eric style: Back is de-emphasized in this microcycle (chest/shoulder priority) but posture is supported via posterior chain (RDL/leg press bias); delt isolation (lateral/Y-raise) supplies upper-back stability.

6. Leg Days

AI style: One squat or RDL block per day, heavier compound bias; no explicit quad-biased machine or glute-biased press instruction.

Eric style: Low-fatigue lower integration: Day 1 RDL/GB leg press; Day 2 machine/Smith squat (quad-biased)—both with strict tempos, modest volume.

Session & Volume Rules

Days: 2 — "day 1" and "day 2".

Day types & themes:

UPPER_PUSH_PLUS_POSTERIOR_CHAIN — heavy push first, posterior-chain finisher.

UPPER_ISO_PLUS_QUAD_GLUTE_VOLUME — upper isolation first, then quad/glute volume.

Working sets/session: target 8 total (4 exercises × 2 sets).

Lead with chest/shoulder work on both days; integrate legs with low-fatigue patterns.

Exercise Selection (use these patterns)

Day 1 (Upper Focus: Heavy Push + Posterior Chain)

Incline DB Press — 2×8–10 @ 3-1-1-0

Flat Bench Cable Press (Bench-Supported) — 2×10–12 @ 3-1-1-0

Cable Lateral Raise (Unilateral) — 2×10–12 @ 3-1-1-0

DB RDL or Glute-Biased Leg Press — 2×8–12 @ 3-1-1-0

Day 2 (Upper Isolation + Quad/Glute Volume)

Incline Bench Cable Stretch Fly — 2×10–12 @ 4-1-1-0

Machine or Smith Shoulder Press — 2×8–10 @ 3-1-1-0

Machine or Smith Squat (Quad-Biased) — 2×10–12 @ 3-1-1-0

Machine Lateral Raise or Incline Cable Y-Raise — 2×12–15 @ 3-1-1-0

Preference order: cable/machine/Smith; DB only where listed. Avoid redundant heavy barbell compounds.

Reps, Tempo, Rest

Use the rep ranges shown above per exercise (upper: 8–12, isolations 10–15).

Tempo: as specified (mostly 3-1-1-0, stretch-biased fly 4-1-1-0).

Rest (rest_sec): 90–120 for compounds, 60–90 for isolations.

  }
}


Constraints

Keep to 2 sets per exercise; no extra accessories beyond the four listed per day.

Use bench support for cable presses where noted; prefer unilateral laterals on Day 1.

Do not include 1RMs or suggested weights; leave "actual_weight": null.

Ensure both days maintain high chest/shoulder volume and brief, hypertrophy-oriented lower work.
