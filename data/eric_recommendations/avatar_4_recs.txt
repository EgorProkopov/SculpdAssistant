Notable Training Style Differences (AI vs. Eric)

1. Sets & Volume Distribution

AI style: Uniform 3 sets on nearly every movement; many days hit 15+ sets, risking time creep. No weekly set budgeting or circuit constraints.

Eric style: 2–3 sets/exercise, ≤14 sets/session under a 40-min cap; sessions built from 1–2 priority compounds + 2–3 secondaries + optional short finisher.

2. Exercise Selection / Novelty

AI style: Standard PPL staples with lots of DB/smith presses, rows, curls; minimal stretch-biased choices; little core work despite “arm focus”.

Eric style: Safe, stable, stretch-biased and isolateral picks (machine chest press/fly, seated ham curl, step-ups, quad extensions, rope pullovers). Frequent machine/cable usage to control ROM and setup time.

3. Muscle Group Structuring / Order

AI style: 6-day PPL with duplicated Pull/Legs and only one Push day; priority areas (arms, core) not consistently led or sprinkled across days.

Eric style: 5-day themed split:

Full Body (Arm+Core) → 2) Lower (Glute/Stability) → 3) Upper Push+Arms → 4) Full-Body Circuit+Core → 5) Upper Pull+Arms.
Arms/core are intentionally sprinkled across most sessions.

4. Rest Times

AI style: Per-exercise set_rest_time 90–120 s but conflicting day rest_time: 60; no time-budget logic; no consistent tempo standard.

Eric style: Rests implicitly sized to ≤40 min total (≈2.5 min/set incl. rest). 3–4 s eccentrics + 1-s stretch pause as default tempo to drive TUT without inflating set count.

5. Back & Pull Days

AI style: Pulldowns/rows + many curl variants; no pullover emphasis; limited angle rotation; few chest-supported options.

Eric style: Angle diversity & biasing (rope/V-grip pullovers, plate-loaded/seated rows, incline cable rows) plus stretch-biased curls; mixes arms into pull days deliberately.

6. Leg Days

AI style: Heavy lower-body volume (leg press, hack squat, RDLs, goblet squat) but no clear glute/quad day separation; calves tacked on; core absent.

Eric style: Two distinct lower focuses:

Glute/Stability (glute bridge, step-ups, ham curl, light-mod leg press, plank)

Quad-dominant + glute finisher (hack squat, stretch-biased extensions, deficit Bulgarians, hip thrust, optional iso-hold).

Weekly Split & Session Rules

Days: 5 ("day 1"…"day 5").

Themes:

Day 1: Full Body (Arm + Core Focus)

Day 2: Lower Body (Glute/Leg Stability)

Day 3: Upper Body (Push + Arms)

Day 4: Full Body Circuit + Core

Day 5: Upper Body (Pull + Arms)

session_duration_min: 40 each day.

Working sets/session: ≤14.

Sets per exercise: 2–3; allow a single short finisher when needed.

Exercise Selection (stable, stretch-biased, fast setup)

Favor machines/cables; use DB/smith only if they don’t slow setup.

Include these patterns across the week (examples in parentheses):

Pull: seated/plate-loaded row, rope/V-grip pullover, pulldown/assisted pull-up.

Push: incline machine/smith press, stretch-biased cable fly, lateral/front raises.

Lower (stability): glute bridge machine, assisted step-ups, seated ham curl, light-moderate leg press.

Quad day: hack squat, stretch-biased quad extension (foam-roller backed), deficit Bulgarian split squat, hip thrust finisher.

Arms/Core sprinkled most days: rope curls, preacher/bench-supported curls, triceps pushdowns/overhead, machine crunches, planks, hanging knee raises.

Reps, Tempo, Rest

Rep ranges: compounds 8–12, isolations 12–15 (core 15–20 or timed).

Tempo: default "3-1-1-0" or "4-1-1-0" (eccentric 3–4 s + 1-s stretch pause).

rest_sec: compounds 90–120, isolations 60–90 (keep total time ≤40 min).

Constraints

Do not include 1RM or recommended weights; keep "actual_weight": null.

Ensure arms & core appear in ≥3 sessions, and lower stability work uses safe, guided paths.

Use stretch-biased variations where specified and avoid redundant heavy pairings that inflate setup time.

Return only the JSON object.
