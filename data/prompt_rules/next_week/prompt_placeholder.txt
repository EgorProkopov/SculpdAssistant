  1. There could be only 2 to 3 sets of any given exercise.
  2. Focus on generating a diverse program on different muscles in current group. Training one muscle can be dangerous.
     Prevent overuse of any single muscle (no more than 2 consecutive exercises per group; alternate sagittal/frontal/transverse planes).
  3. Choose set_rest_time only between 90 seconds, short rest for for smaller muscle groups (delts, triceps, biceps), 120 seconds for larger (chest, back, quads, hamstrings, glutes). Only 90 or 120 seconds.
  4. Make the training plan non-boring: include 2–3 interesting movements per session
  (unilateral, multi-plane, tempo/pause variations; kettlebells, TRX, sled, battle ropes, farmer’s carry),
  cap the big three to ≤50% of volume, and provide purpose + a safe regression.
  5. Mix order of involved muscles.
  6. Follow global style & philosophy:
    * Hypertrophy via controlled tempo, high ROM, and stable setups.
    * Favor machines/cables/Smith for joint safety and precision; use DB/barbell only when ROI is high.
    * Lead sessions with priority muscles; alternate push ↔ pull patterns inside sessions to manage fatigue; isolations at the end.
    * Avoid redundant heavy pairings (e.g., squat + leg press same day) unless volume is deliberately reduced.
    * No junk sets; every set has intent.
  7. Follow exercise selection recommendations (pattern-first; stretch-biased where relevant):
    * Chest: incline press (DB/Smith/machine), flat/Smith press, incline/upper cable fly (stretch-biased), mid-chest staggered-stance cable fly, decline/downward fly, bench-supported cable press.
    * Back – Lats: supinated/neutral pulldown, rope pullover (standing or incline), kneeling single-arm low cable row (lat line).
    * Back – Upper-back thickness: plate-loaded chest-supported row, incline bench unilateral cable row (mid/low origin), rope row to upper chest, face pulls for scapular health.
    * Shoulders: machine/cable lateral raise (priority), Y-raises, front raises, Smith/DB shoulder press, upright rows (Smith/cable), reverse fly (stretch-biased).
    * Quads: hack squat (low/close stance), foam-roller backed quad extensions (stretch-biased), quad-biased leg press, deficit Bulgarian split squat.
    * Ham/Glute: seated/lying ham curl (stretch-biased), RDL or Smith deficit RDL, hip thrust/bridge, long-stride lunges, abduction/kickbacks; glute-biased leg press.
    * Arms: rope curls, incline cable curls, drag curls, preacher; triceps pushdowns + overhead extensions (long-head bias).
    * Calves/Core: seated/standing calf raise; machine crunch, hanging knee raise, planks.
    * Prefer chest-supported and guided-path variants to reduce fatigue leakage.
    * Include angle/plane rotation week to week (incline → mid; pulldown → pullover; row origins; lateral raise variants).
